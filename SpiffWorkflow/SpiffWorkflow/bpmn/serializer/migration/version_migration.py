    Upgrade v1.1 serialization to v1.2.

    Expressions in timer event definitions have been converted from python expressions to 
    ISO 8601 expressions.

    Cycle timers no longer connect back to themselves.  New children are created from a single
    tasks rather than reusing previously executed tasks.

    All conditions (including the default) are included in the conditions for gateways.

    Data inputs and outputs on process specs were moved inside a BPMNIOSpecification, and
    are now TaskDataReferences; BpmnDataSpecifications that referred to Data Objects are
    now DataObjects.

    Multiinstance tasks were completely refactored, in a way that is simply too difficult to
    migrate.

    Loop reset tasks were removed.

    Starting with Spiff 1.1.8, subworkflows are no longer integrated in main task tree.  When
    a subworkflow (a subprocess, transaction, or call activity) is reached, a subprocss is
    added to the top level workflow and the task enters a waiting state until the workflow
    completes.

    To make the serialization backwards compatible, we delete the tasks from the main workflow
    task list and add them to the appropriate subprocess and recreate the remaining subprocess
