class BpmnWorkflowSerializer:
    """This class implements a customizable BPMN Workflow serializer, based on the `DefaultRegistry`.

    Workflows contain two types of objects: workflows/tasks/standard specs (objects that Spiff provides
    serialization for automatically) and arbitrary data (associated with tasks and workflows).  The goal
    of this serializer is to provide a mechanism that allows for handling both, as well as the ability
    to replace one of the default internal conversion mechanisms with your own if you've extended any of
    the classes.

    See `configure` for more details on customization.

    Serialization occurs in two phases: the first is to convert everything in the workflow to a
    dictionary containing only JSON-serializable objects and the second is dumping to JSON, which happens
    only at the very end.

    Attributes:
        registry (`DictionaryConverter`): a registry that keeps track of all objects the serializer knows
        json_encoder_cls: passed into `convert` to provides additional json encding capabilities (optional)
        json_decoder_cls: passed into `restore` to provide additional json decoding capabilities (optional)
        version (str): the serializer version

        If you have replaced any of the default classes that Spiff uses with your own, Spiff will not know
        how to serialize them and you'll have to provide conversion mechanisms.

        The `config` is a dictionary with keys for each (Spiff) class that needs to be handled that map to a
        converter for that class.  There are some basic converters which provide from methods for handling
        essential Spiff attributes in the `helpers` package of this module; the default converters, found in
        the `defaults` package of this module extend these.  The default configuration is found in `config`.

        The `registry` contains optional custom data conversions and the items in `config` will be added to
        it, to create one repository of information about serialization.  See `DictionaryConverter` for more
        information about customized data.  This parameter is optional and if not provided, `DefaultRegistry`
        will be used.

        Objects that are unknown to the `registry` will be passed on as-is and serialization can be handled
        through custom JSON encoding/decoding as an alternative.
