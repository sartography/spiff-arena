    Task Spec for a bpmn:endEvent node.

    From the specification of BPMN (http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF -
    document number:formal/2011-01-03): For a "terminate" End Event, the
    Process is abnormally terminated - no other ongoing Process instances are
    affected.

    For all other End Events, the behavior associated with the Event type is
    performed, e.g., the associated Message is sent for a Message End Event,
    the associated signal is sent for a Signal End Event, and so on. The
    Process instance is then completed, if and only if the following two
    conditions hold:
     * All start nodes of the Process have been visited. More precisely, all
       Start Events have been triggered, and for all starting Event-Based
       Gateways, one of the associated Events has been triggered.
     * There is no token remaining within the Process instance.
