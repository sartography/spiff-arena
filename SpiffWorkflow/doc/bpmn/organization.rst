Organizing More Complex Workflows
=================================

BPMN Model
----------

We'll be using the following files from `spiff-example-cli <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli>`_.

- `lanes <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli/blob/main/tutorial/bpmn/lanes.bpmn>`_ workflow
- `top_level <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli/blob/main/bpmn/tutorial/top_level.bpmn>`_ workflow
- `call_activity <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli/blob/main/tutorial/bpmn/call_activity.bpmn>`_ workflow
- `product_prices <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli/blob/main/tutorial/bpmn/product_prices.dmn>`_ DMN table
- `shipping_costs <https://github.com/sartography/spiff-example-cli/blob/main/bpmn/tutorial/shipping_costs.dmn>`_ DMN table

Lanes
^^^^^

Lanes are a method in BPMN to distinguish roles for the workflow and who is
responsible for which actions. In some cases this will be different business
units, and in some cases this will be different individuals - it really depends
on the nature of the workflow.  Within the BPMN editor, this is done by choosing the
'Create pool/participant' option from the toolbar on the left hand side.

We'll modify our workflow to get the customer's payment information and send it
to an employee who will charge the customer and fulfill the order.

   Workflow with lanes

To run this workflow

.. code-block:: console

   ./spiff-bpmn-runner.py -p order_product \
        -d bpmn/tutorial/product_prices.dmn bpmn/tutorial/shipping_costs.dmn \
        -b bpmn/tutorial/lanes.bpmn

For a simple code example of displaying a tasks lane, see `Handling Lanes`_

Subprocesses
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Subprocesses allow us to conceptualize a group of tasks as a unit by creating a 
mini-workflow inside a task.  Subprocess Tasks come in two different flavors: expanded
or collapsed.  The difference between the two types is visual rather than functional.  

It also possible to refer to external processes via a Call Activity Task. This
allows us to 'call' a separate Process (which might be stored independently of the
Process we're implementing) by referencing the ID of the called Process, which can simplify
business logic and make it re-usable.

We'll expand 'Fulfill Order' into sub tasks -- retrieving the product and shipping
the order -- and create an Expanded Subprocess.

We'll also expand our selection of products, adding several new products and the ability
to customize certain products by size and style in addition to color.

   Updated product list

.. note::

   I've added what customizations are available for each product in the 'Annotations'
   column of the DMN table.  This is not actually used by Spiff; it simply provides
   the option of documenting the decisions contained in the table.

Since adding gateways for navigating the new options will add a certain amount of
clutter to our diagram, we'll create a separate workflow for selecting and customizing
products and refer to that in our main workflow.

We need to make sure the 'Called Element' matches the ID we assigned in the called Process.

Running the Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   ./spiff-bpmn-runner.py -p order_product \
        -d bpmn/tutorial/product_prices.dmn bpmn/tutorial/shipping_costs.dmn \
        -b bpmn/tutorial/top_level.bpmn bpmn/tutorial/call_activity.bpmn

Example Application Code
------------------------

Handling Lanes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are not required to handle lanes in our application, but most of the time we'll
probably want a way of filtering on lanes and selectively displaying tasks.  In
our sample application, we'll simply display which lane a task belongs to.

.. code:: python

    def get_task_description(self, task, include_state=True):

        task_spec = task.task_spec
        lane = f'{task_spec.lane}' if task_spec.lane is not None else '-'
        name = task_spec.bpmn_name if task_spec.bpmn_name is not None else '-'
        description = task_spec.description if task_spec.description is not None else 'Task'
        state = f'{task.get_state_name()}' if include_state else ''
        return f'[{lane}] {name} ({description}: {task_spec.bpmn_id}) {state}'

The tasks lane can be obtained from :code:`task.task_spec.lane`, which will be :code:`None`
if the task is not part of a lane.

See the Filtering Tasks Section of :doc:`advanced` more information about working with lanes in Spiff.
