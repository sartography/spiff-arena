Core Library
============

SpiffWorkflow's BPMN support is built on top of a core library that aims to be a general workflow
execution environment.  Workflow specifications can be created from a simple XML format, or even
easily in python code.  It supports a wide range of task specifications and workflow patterns, making
it amenable to adaptation to many different schemas for defining workflow behavior.
