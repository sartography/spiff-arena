======================

**SpiffWorkflow is a library that provides a flexible workflow execution environment.**

Recent development has largely focused on allowing Python applications to process
BPMN diagrams (think of them as very powerful flow charts; see :doc:`bpmn/intro`). to
accomplish what would otherwise require writing a lot of complex business logic in your
code. You can use these diagrams to accomplish a number of tasks, such as:

 - Creating a questionnaire with multiple complex paths
 - Implement an approval process that requires input from multiple users
 - Allow non-programmers to modify the flow and behavior of your application
 - Visualize and manage long running data processing tasks

related projects including SpiffArena, Service Connectors, and BPMN.js
extensions.
