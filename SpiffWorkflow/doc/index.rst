What is SpiffWorkflow?
======================

    :align: center

SpiffWorkflow allows your python application to process BPMN diagrams (think
of them as very powerful flow charts,  See :doc:`intro`.) to accomplish
what would otherwise require writing a lot of complex business logic in your
code. You can use these diagrams to accomplish a number of tasks, such as:

 - Creating a questionnaire with multiple complex paths
 - Implement an approval process that requires input from multiple users
 - Allow non-programmers to modify the flow and behavior of your application.
