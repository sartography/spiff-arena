# Displaying Content

The SpiffArena platform offers powerful features for displaying 
content  within your BPMN processes.
Follow the steps below to effectively display content in your 
processes:

In this guide, we'll explore how to effectively display content in 
SpiffArena, providing a seamless user experience and engaging 
presentation of information. 

Let's dive in and learn the key aspects of displaying content within 
your workflows.

## Markdown: Formatting Content

Markdown is a powerful tool for formatting and styling your content in 
SpiffArena. With Markdown, you can easily add headings, lists, tables, 
hyperlinks, and more to enhance the readability and visual appeal of 
your displayed content. 

## Jinja Templating: Dynamic Content Generation

Jinja Templating in SpiffArena empowers you to generate dynamic 
content based on variables, conditions, and logic. By leveraging 
Jinja's syntax and functionality, you can customize your content to 
adapt to specific scenarios, display personalized information, or 
perform calculations based on collected data.

## Combining Markdown and Jinja: Unleashing the Power

By utilizing the strengths of Markdown and Jinja, you can create rich, 
interactive, and data-driven content that goes beyond static text.
We'll demonstrate using an example on how to leverage Markdown and 
Jinja together to create captivating content that responds to user 
input and presents  dynamic information.

## Basic Example for displaying content

In our SpiffArena dashboard, we have a simple example of how to 
display content in the basics section. Now, let's explore the process 
workflow of the content display process model and discover various 
ways to present content in different scenarios.


### Display Content Process Overview

Here is a summary of the process:

1. **Start Event and Introduction Manual Task**

The process begins with a Start Event, signaling the start of the 
workflow.

It is followed by a Manual Task called "Introduction" that displays a 
welcome message or instructions for the users. The content to be 
displayed is specified in the task's properties panel.

2. **User Task with Form**

A User Task named "simple form" is included, allowing users to 
complete a form.
The properties panel of the User Task contains a JSON form schema, 
defining the structure of the form.
The instructions panel of the User Task guides users to fill out the 
form, indicating that the entered values will be shown in the 
subsequent Manual Task.

3. **Script Tasks**

Three Script Tasks are incorporated into the process, each serving a 
specific purpose.
Script Task 1 introduces a delay using the code "time.sleep(3)" and 
generates a dictionary of colors.
Script Task 2 includes a delay with the code "time.sleep(1)" and 
focuses on making the colors more playful.
Script Task 3 includes a delay with the code "time.sleep(2)" and aims 
to increase the silliness level.

A Manual Task will display content based on the collected data 
and script-generated information. The instructions panel of the Manual 
Task provides the content to be displayed, which includes the form 
data entered by the user.
It also offers an optional Chuck Norris joke based on user preference 
and a table of silly color names generated using Jinja templating.
