# Data Objects

In BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a data object represents the information or data used and produced by activities within a business process.
It signifies the data elements or artifacts that are relevant to the process and provides a means to model the flow of data through the process.
They aid in elucidating the data flow and dependencies within the process, thus making it more straightforward to comprehend how information is utilized and transformed throughout the process execution.

**Reasons to use data objects:**

- To represent and manage data within a business process.

- When it's necessary to make a specific reference to data being used.

- When dependencies exist between tasks or activities based on shared data.

- When data changes within a process.

- If data needs to be stored or retrieved for use in a process.
