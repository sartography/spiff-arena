# Deployment

The minimal deployment is to mimic the docker-compose.yml file at the root of spiff-arena.
Steps for a more hardened production setup after that baseline include:

 1. setting up a MySQL or PostgreSQL database for Backend persistence (instead of sqlite)
 2. setting up a Redis/Valkey or RabbitMQ server for a Celery broker.
 2. separating out the Backend deployment into three deployments, 1) API, 2) Background, and 3) Celery worker.

graph TD;
    subgraph Backend
        A[API]
        B[Background]
        Ce[Celery Worker]
    end
    F[Frontend]
    Co[Connector Proxy]
    D[Database]
    A --> D
    B --> D
    Ce --> D
    F -- Communicates with --> Backend
    Backend -- delegates to --> Co
```

API, Celery Worker, Connector Proxy, and Frontend can run any number of replicas.
The Background container is like a cron container, so it should run only one replica.
