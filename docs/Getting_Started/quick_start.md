Choose the process you want to initiate and click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_7.png)

You have successfully started a new process instance in SpiffWorkflow.

 If a process model doesn't have an associated BPMN file, the system will not display a start button. This is to prevent confusion and errors that might arise from attempting to start an incomplete process model.

---

## How to respond to a request

When using SpiffWorkflow, knowing how to respond to requests is essential to the process.
While each request may have unique requirements, the basic steps for responding are similar.
The following steps will guide you through the process of responding to requests.

### Step 1: Navigate to the home page

Once you are signed in, navigate to the home page of SpiffWorkflow.
On the home page, you will see a list of all the requests that are available to you.

There will be three types of instances shown:

- **Started by me:** This section shows a list of process instances that were started by you, providing you with an overview of the instances you have initiated.
- **Waiting for me:** This section displays a list of process instances with tasks assigned to you and are currently waiting for you to respond to.
- **Waiting for [team name]:** If you are a member of SpiffWorkflow**,** this section displays a list of process instances with tasks assigned to a group you are a member of and currently waiting for someone in that group to complete them.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_8.png)

In the case of new users who haven't started or been part of any process or been assigned to any team, you won't be able to see any items on the home page.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_9.png)

### Step 2: Respond to the request

Once you have identified the request you need to respond to, simply click on the 'Go' button in the action column to open it.
Upon opening the process instance, you can respond to the request based on the requirements of that task.

## How to Interpret Colors in a BPMN Diagram

 One of the key features of BPMN diagrams in SpiffWorkflow is the use of colors to represent different states or statuses of process instances.

 Here are the colors used in BPMN Process:

1. **Grey Color:**  
   - **Meaning:** The task is completed.
   - **Implication:** Tasks or activities associated with this process have been successfully completed, and no further action is required.

![Colors](images/Grey_color.png)

2. **Yellow Color:**  
   - **Meaning:** The process instance has started and is currently in progress.
   - **Implication:** This color signifies that the task is active and ongoing. It may require monitoring or further inputs to proceed.

   ![Colors](images/Yellow.png)


3. **Red/Pink Color:**  
   - **Meaning:** Indicates errors in the task.
   - **Implication:** There might be issues or obstacles preventing the task from proceeding as expected. Immediate attention and troubleshooting may be required.

   ![Colors](images/Red.png)

4. **Purple Color:**  
   - **Meaning:** The activity has been cancelled.
   - **Implication:** This task was intentionally stopped before completion. This could be due to time constraints, external triggers, or other predefined conditions that have been set as boundary events.

   ![Colors](images/Purple.png)

## How to check Milestones and Events

### Milestones
A milestone is a specific point in a process that signifies a significant event or state. It provides a high-level overview of the progress made in the process.

In BPMN, if you draw an intermediate event and do not specify its type (like message, signal, start, or end) but give it a name, it becomes a milestone.
Essentially, a milestone is an event that hasn't been set to something specific.


### Events
Events provide a detailed log of everything that happens in a process. They record every task and its execution time.

![Events](images/Events.png)

The events tab provides a detailed log of all the tasks and their execution times.
It can be noisy due to the granularity of the information, but it's essential for understanding the intricacies of the process.

---
## How to check messages
Messages in BPMN allow processes to communicate with each other. This communication can take various forms:

- Two processes running concurrently, exchanging messages.
- One process initiating another through a message.
- An external system making an API call, passing a payload (like a JSON data structure) that can either communicate with an ongoing process or initiate a new one.

### The Waiter-Chef Illustration

To explain the concept, we are using a relatable example involving two processes: the Waiter and the Chef.

**Waiter Process**:
![Waiter Process](images/waiter.png)

1. The waiter takes an order.
2. This order is then communicated to the chef via a message.
3. The waiter then waits for a response from the chef, indicating the order's readiness.

**Chef Process**:

![Chef Process](images/chef.png)

1. The chef starts by receiving the order message from the waiter.
2. After preparing the meal, the chef sends a message back to the waiter, signaling that the order is ready.


### Setting Up the Processes

The setup involves creating two process models named "Chef" and "Waiter."
The waiter's process involves taking an order, setting up variables like table number, drink, and meal, and then sending a message to the chef.
The chef's process starts by listening for the order message, preparing the meal, and then sending a confirmation message back to the waiter.


### Correlation Keys and Properties

One of the complexities in BPMN messaging is ensuring that the right processes are communicating with each other, especially when multiple instances are running.
This is achieved using correlation keys and properties.

![corelation](images/Corelation.png)

- **Correlation Keys**: These represent the topic of the conversation. In the given example, the correlation key is the "order".
  
- **Correlation Properties**: These are unique identifiers within the conversation. In the example, the "table number" serves as the correlation property, ensuring the right waiter communicates with the right chef.

### Execution and Observation

Upon executing the waiter's process, it sends a message to the chef and waits.
The chef's process, upon receiving the message, requires user input (indicating the meal's completion).
Once the chef confirms the meal's readiness, a message is sent back to the waiter, completing both processes.

## How to share process instance with Short Links
The short link feature provides a convenient way to share process instances with others without the need to copy and paste lengthy URLs. This feature is especially useful for quick sharing via email, messaging apps, or within documentation.

To copy the short link:

- **Access the Process Instance**: Open the process instance that you wish to share.
- **Find the Short Link Icon**: Look for the link icon near the process instance heading and click on the link icon to copy the short link to your clipboard automatically. please refer to the screenshot provided.

![Short Link](images/Short_link.png)

Now, you can paste the short link into your desired communication medium to share it with others.

## How to View Who Completed User Forms

To access and review completed user forms within a specific process model, follow these guidelines:

1. **Find the Tasks Tab in Process Instance**:  Begin by going to the process instance and scroll to locate the 'Tasks' tab. This area displays all user forms connected to the process.

2. **Examine Completed Forms**: 
   - **Forms You Completed**: In this section, you can view the forms that you have completed. It allows you to see the specific details and inputs you provided in each task.
   ![Completed by me](images/Completed_by_me.png)

   - **Forms Completed by Others**: This part shows all the forms completed by any user. You can see who completed each form and the last time it was updated. However, for privacy and security reasons, you won't be able to view the specific input details of forms completed by others.
   ![Completed by others](images/Completed_by_others.png)

This approach ensures you can monitor and review the progress of user forms within any process model while maintaining the confidentiality of inputs made by other users.

## How to view task instance history

Monitoring the history of task instances is helpful for tracking the progress and execution details of a workflow. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to access and understand the task instance history, including the interpretation of task statuses.

### Steps to Access Task Instance History

1. **Run the Process**: Initiate a workflow process in SpiffWorkflow.

2. **Access the Process Instance**: After running the process, navigate to the specific process instance within the SpiffWorkflow interface. This is where you can track the progress of the tasks.
![Access process instance](images/Access_Process_Instance.png)

3. **View Task Details**: Click on the executed task or event that has been completed. For instance, in this example we clicked on "user task".
![Access task instance](images/Task_instance.png)

You will be presented with detailed information about each task instance, including its status and execution timestamp. 

For example:
   - `2 : 04-01-2024 19:58:11 - MAYBE`
   - `3 : 04-01-2024 19:58:10 - COMPLETED`
   - `4 : 04-01-2024 19:58:07 - COMPLETED`
![Access task instance](images/task_instance_history.png)


- **COMPLETED Status**: Tasks marked as 'COMPLETED' have finished their execution successfully and have moved the workflow forward.
- **MAYBE Status**: Indicates that the task still exists within SpiffWorkflow. While these tasks could be omitted for clarity, retaining them provides a complete picture of the workflow's execution.

Viewing task instance history in SpiffWorkflow is now more streamlined and informative, thanks to recent updates. Users can effectively track each task's execution, status, and timing, gaining insights into the workflow's overall performance.
