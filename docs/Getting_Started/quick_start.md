## üîÑ How to respond to a request

When using SpiffWorkflow, knowing how to respond to requests is essential to the process. While each request may have unique requirements, the basic steps for responding are similar. The following steps will guide you through the process of responding to requests.

### Step 1: Navigate to the home page

Once you are signed in, navigate to the home page of SpiffWorkflow. On the home page, you will see a list of all the requests that are available to you.  

There will be three types of instances shown: 

- **Started by me:** This section shows a list of process instances that were started by you, providing you with an overview of the instances you have initiated.
- **Waiting for me:** This section displays a list of process instances with tasks assigned to you and are currently waiting for you to respond to.
- **Waiting for [team name]:** If you are a member of SpiffWorkflow**,** this section displays a list of process instances with tasks assigned to a group you are a member of and currently waiting for someone in that group to complete them.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_8.png)

In the case of new users who haven't started or been part of any process or been assigned to any team, you won't be able to see any items on the home page.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_9.png)

### Step 2: Respond to the request

Once you have identified the request you need to respond to, simply click on the 'Go' button in the action column to open it. Upon opening the process instance, you can respond to the request based on the requirements of that task. 

Depending on the task requirements, this may involve submitting additional information, reviewing the task or any other action item.

## üîç How to view and filter process instances

As you work on various process instances in SpiffWorkflow, you may want to view and filter some of them. This can help you track the status of various instances and manage them more efficiently. 

Here are the steps to view and filter process instances in SpiffWorkflow.

### Step 1: Navigate to Process Instances

Once you are signed in, navigate to the "Process Instances" section. Within the "Process Instances" section, you'll see a list of all the instances for the processes you can access.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_19.png)

If you are on a homepage, you can navigate to the table you wish to filter. Look for the black funnel icon in the top right-hand corner above the table and click on the Icon: By clicking on the filter icon, you'll be taken to a full-screen process view.

![Filter Icon](images/Filter_icon.png)

### Step 2: Click on Filter option

To filter the list, click on the "Filter" option. This will expand the filter section where you will be able to provide details about the process instance. This allows you to enter various details, including the process model, start date, end date, and time. To refine your search, you can enter multiple filter parameters.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_20.png)

### Step 3: Apply Filters

Once you have entered all the relevant filter details, click on the "**Apply**" button to apply the filters. The system will then display all the process instances matching the input details.

![Untitled](images/Untitled_28.png)

If you want to filter by ID, go to the "Find by Id" section of the page. Enter the ID and click "Submit". The system will show you the process instance with the corresponding ID.

You can now view the process instances that you filtered for and take appropriate action based on their status. This can help you manage your workflows more efficiently and keep track of the progress of various process instances.



## How to check Milestones and Events

### Milestones
A milestone is a specific point in a process that signifies a significant event or state. It provides a high-level overview of the progress made in the process.

In BPMN, if you draw an intermediate event and do not specify its type (like message, signal, start, or end) but give it a name, it becomes a milestone. Essentially, a milestone is an event that hasn't been set to something specific.


### Events
Events provide a detailed log of everything that happens in a process. They record every task and its execution time.

![Events](images/Events.png)

The events tab provides a detailed log of all the tasks and their execution times. It can be noisy due to the granularity of the information, but it's essential for understanding the intricacies of the process.
