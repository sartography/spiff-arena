## Suspend a Process

By suspending a process instance, you temporarily halt its execution, allowing you to access and modify the necessary data or configurations associated with that specific instance.
This feature is not only useful for making updates, but also enables the possibility to redo a previous step with different metadata if needed.

> **Step 1: Find the Active Process Instance**

- In order to locate the active process instance, have a look at these pages to find an instance to suspend.

```{admonition} Note

âš  Note that the suspension of a process instance is only applicable to active instances.
If an instance is not active, it indicates that the process has already been completed, and therefore, it cannot be suspended.

```

> **Step 2: Locate Suspend Icon**

This action will pause the process instance, granting you the ability to make edits and modifications.
When ready, the process instance can be resumed.
The process instance remains highlighted in yellow.
