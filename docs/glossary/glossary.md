# Glossary

## Activity

Refers to the work carried out by an individual or an organization within a process. Activities can be classified into three categories: Task, Subprocess, and Call Activity. These activities can be either atomic or non-atomic. Atomic activities are indivisible and represent single tasks, while non-atomic activities involve multiple steps or subprocesses that work together to achieve a larger objective.
