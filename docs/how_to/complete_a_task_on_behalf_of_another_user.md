👟 Steps to follow for successfully carrying out an activity and changing instance variables should it be required.

## 🏞 **Scenario**

A task is assigned to a user who is responsible for completing it. However, due to various reasons, the user may find themselves unable to finish the task within the designated time frame. In such situations, the instance can be completed **by you** **on behalf of the user.** 
This enables a smooth continuation of the process from the initial user's perspective, allowing them to move on to the next task when they are ready.
