## ðŸ“”How to guide

### **Step 1: Find the active Process Instance** 

```{admonition} Note

âš  Note that the suspension of a Process Instance is only applicable to active instances. 
If an instance is not active, it indicates that the process has already been completed, and therefore, it cannot be suspended.
```

In order to locate the active Process Instance, have a look at these pages to find an active instance to suspend.
