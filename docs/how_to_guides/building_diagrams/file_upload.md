# File Upload and Markdown Link Display

This guide documents a process in Spiffworkflow where a user uploads a file, the system generates a downloadable markdown link to the file, and then displays that link back to the user in a follow-up task.

This can be used for tasks such as submitting documents, generating downloadable reports, or capturing file inputs for later reference or distribution.

## Process Overview

![File Upload Process](/images/file_upload_process.png)

This process allows a user to upload a file using a form. The uploaded file is converted into a markdown-compatible link by a script, and the link is then shown to the user in a final confirmation task.

Workflow Steps:

- User uploads a file in the initial task.
- A script task converts the file into a markdown download link.
- A confirmation message is displayed with the link.

## Task Configuration Details

### 1. User Task: Example Manual Task
**Type**: User Task  
**Purpose**: Collect a file upload from the user.  
**UI Output**: Presents a file selection form with a "Submit" and "Save and Close" button.

#### JSON Schema (Form Definition)

```json
{
  "title": "Files",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "file": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "data-url",
      "title": "Single file"
    }
  }
}
```

- `file`: This property captures a file as a data URL string. The file is stored in a process variable named `file`.

#### UI Schema

```json
{
  "filesAccept": {
    "ui:options": {
      "accept": ".pdf"
    }
  }
}
```

- The `"accept"` attribute can be configured to restrict allowed file types (e.g., ".pdf", ".png", ".jpg").

#### UI Behavior

- Users click "Choose File" and select a document to upload.
- After selection, the file name, type, and size are shown.
- On clicking "Submit", the file is passed as a data URL to the next task.

**File Upload Step**  
The interface displays the uploaded filename, type, and size before submission.

### 2. Script Task: Generate Link to File
**Type**: Script Task  
**Purpose**: Convert the uploaded file into a markdown-compatible download link.

#### Script

```python
link = markdown_file_download_link(file)
```

- `file`: This is the input variable from the previous task.
- `markdown_file_download_link()` is a built-in function that generates a string like:

  ```markdown
  [filename.ext](https://your-server.com/path/to/file)
  ```

- The output is stored in the process variable `link`.

### 3. Manual Task: Display Link to File
**Type**: Manual Task  
**Purpose**: Show a confirmation message to the user with a clickable link.

#### Instructions (Displayed Text)

```
Thanks for uploading a file!  
Here is a link: {{link}}
```

- The `{{link}}` variable is dynamically replaced with the markdown download link generated in the previous step.

**Display Link to File Step**  
This shows a text message with a link: [filename.ext]‚Äù

You can modify the final message formatting to include file size or type if those details are captured.
