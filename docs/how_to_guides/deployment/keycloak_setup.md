# Keycloak Setup Guide for Clients 

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication, authorization, and user management features. 

This guide outlines the steps to configure Keycloak for a client, including **granting admin privileges** within a realm and **allowing users to log in using Google authentication**.  

## **1. Super Admin Tasks: Allowing Realm User Management**  

To allow user management in a specific **Keycloak realm**, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Select the Realm in the Keycloak Admin Console**  
Log in to the **Keycloak Admin Console**. Select the realm you wish to allow access to.

### **Step 2: Enable `security-admin-console` for the Realm**  

Navigate to **Clients**.  Search for **security-admin-console**.  Ensure that it is **enabled** for the realm.

### **Step 3: Assign Admin Roles to a User**  
To grant a user admin access for adding/managing users:  
- Navigate to **Users** in the left sidebar. Find or create the user who needs admin privileges.

- Open the user’s profile and go to the **Role Mapping** tab.Add the following roles:  
   - `view-users`  
   - `manage-users`

- If you want to grant **full admin access**, search for **realm-management** and grant **all permissions** within realm management.

### **Step 4: Provide the Admin URL**  
After assigning roles, provide the user with the following URL to access the **Admin Console**:

```
https://keycloak-[CLIENT'S DOMAIN].spiff.works/admin/[REALM_NAME]/console
```

#### **Example:**  
For a client named **Civitos**, the URL would be:  
```
https://keycloak-civitos.spiff.works/admin/spiffworkflow/console/#/spiffworkflow/users
```

## **2. Allowing Everyone from Your Domain to Log into an Instance**  
*(This example covers **Google as an Identity Provider**, but similar steps can be followed for other providers.)*  

### **Step 1: Set Up Google as an Identity Provider**  
1. Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
2. Select the project associated with Keycloak (**e.g., `spiffdemo-keycloak`**).  
3. In the search bar, type **“Clients”**.  
4. Click on **+ Create Client**.

### **Step 2: Configure the OAuth Client**  
1. Choose **"Web Application"** as the client type.  
2. Enter a meaningful name based on the client, e.g., **"Jons-chess-boards"**.  
3. **Leave "Authorized JavaScript Origins" blank.**  
4. In the **Authorized Redirect URIs** section, add the following:

   ```
   https://[KEYCLOAK-FOR-CLIENT]/realms/[REALM]/broker/google/endpoint
   ```

   Typically, this would look something like:

   ```
   https://keycloak-jons-chess-boards.spiff.works/realms/spiffworkflow/broker/google/endpoint
   ```

5. Save the configuration and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### **Step 3: Add Google as an Identity Provider in Keycloak**  
1. Go to the **Keycloak Admin Console**.  
2. Select the appropriate **Realm**.  
3. Navigate to **Identity Providers** → **Add Provider** → **Google**.  
4. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google.  
5. Set **First Login Flow** to `first broker login` (or another authentication flow if required).  
6. Click **Save**.

### **Step 4: Test Login**  
- Navigate to the client’s login page and verify that **Google Login** is now an option.  
- Ensure that users from the domain can successfully authenticate using Google.


By following these steps, you can successfully:  
✔ Grant **admin access** to a user for managing the realm.  
✔ Enable **Google-based authentication** for all users in a client’s domain.  

This setup ensures a secure and efficient user authentication process within **Keycloak**, providing administrators with the ability to manage users effectively while allowing users to authenticate seamlessly using Google.

## 3. API Authentication & Integration with Keycloak

Now we provide guide for developers on how to authenticate with SpiffWorkflow using Keycloak, interact with backend API endpoints, and integrate these flows into a custom frontend or testing tool like Postman or curl.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

* The SpiffWorkflow backend is running and configured to use Keycloak for authentication.
* A Keycloak realm (`spiffworkflow`) is already set up, with appropriate client and user configurations.
* A valid Keycloak user has been created with access roles (e.g., `user-group`, `admin-group`).
* If using the local setup:

  * Keycloak runs on `localhost:7002`
  * Backend runs on `localhost:7000`

### Starting Keycloak & Backend (Local Setup)

```bash
cd spiffworkflow-backend

# Start Keycloak server
./keycloak/bin/start_keycloak

# Run backend server configured to use Keycloak
./bin/run_server_locally keycloak
```

> Keep both services running in separate terminals. Ensure the backend is correctly talking to Keycloak.

### Acquiring a Bearer Token (Password Grant)

To authenticate a user and get a valid access token, send a POST request to Keycloak’s token endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://keycloak-[client].spiff.works/realms/spiffworkflow/protocol/openid-connect/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=spiff-frontend" \
  -d "username=<user_email>" \
  -d "password=<user_password>"
```

Alternatively, for local development:

```bash
KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7002 ./bin/get_token > /tmp/token
```

### Making API Requests to SpiffWorkflow

Once you have an access token, use it to call protected endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7000/v1.0/process-groups \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat /tmp/token)"
```

### Common SpiffWorkflow API Endpoints

| Purpose                                  | Method & Endpoint                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Get all tasks for the authenticated user | `GET /v1.0/tasks`                             |
| List all accessible process groups       | `GET /v1.0/process-groups`                    |
| Get all models in a group                | `GET /v1.0/process-models/<process_group_id>` |
| Complete a task                          | `POST /v1.0/tasks/{task_id}/complete`         |
| API documentation browser (Swagger UI)   | `GET /v1.0/ui`                                |

> All endpoints must include a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Logging Out from Keycloak

To revoke a session and log out a user via the Keycloak API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://keycloak-[client].spiff.works/realms/spiffworkflow/protocol/openid-connect/logout \
  -d "client_id=spiff-frontend" \
  -d "client_secret=<client_secret>" \
  -d "refresh_token=<refresh_token>"
```

This invalidates the token and ends the session in Keycloak.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue                                  | Resolution                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add_user_error` on login              | Ensure the user is created in the `spiffworkflow` realm, not the default `master`. Assign proper group roles. |
| Token works but API returns empty data | Confirm user has been assigned to the correct group (e.g., `user-group`) in Keycloak.                         |
| Postman shows missing `code=` field    | `code` is not required for password-based flow. Ignore or comment out related logic.                          |
| Token not accepted by backend          | Ensure the token is sent as a `Bearer` in the `Authorization` header.                                         |
| Logout doesn't work                    | Make sure you're using `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` correctly.                           |


This flow enables secure API-based integration while retaining centralized identity control via Keycloak.
