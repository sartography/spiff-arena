## Overview of Extension Methods

**Extensions**: Add custom frontend UI components and pages to the SpiffArena interface. Perfect for creating custom dashboards, reports, or user tools that integrate seamlessly with the main application.

**Global Scripts**: Define reusable backend logic and data processing functions that can be used across all your process models. Ideal for centralizing business logic and custom calculations.

**Connectors**: Build custom integrations with external systems and APIs. Use connectors to interact with databases, web services, and other business systems from your process models.

## Choosing the Right Extension Method

- **Use Extensions** when you need to add new user interfaces, custom pages, or modify the frontend experience
- **Use Global Scripts** when you need reusable backend logic, data processing, or calculations that multiple process models can share
- **Use Connectors** when you need to integrate with external systems, APIs, or databases

These extension methods work well together and can be combined to create comprehensive custom solutions for your organization.
