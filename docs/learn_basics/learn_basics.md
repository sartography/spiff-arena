## BPMN and SpiffWorkflow

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a diagramming language for specifying business processes. BPMN links the realms of business and IT, and creates a common process language that can be shared between the two.

BPMN describes details of process behaviors efficiently in a diagram. The meaning is precise enough to describe the technical details that control process execution in an automation engine. SpiffWorkflow allows you to create code to directly execute a BPMN diagram.

When using SpiffWorkflow, a client can manipulate the BPMN diagram and still have their product work without a need for you to edit the Python code, improving response and turnaround time.
