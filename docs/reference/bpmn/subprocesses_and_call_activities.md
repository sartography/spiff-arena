# Sub-Processes and Call Activities

Sub-processes and call activities are both useful for simplifying and organizing complex workflows within larger processes.
They serve distinct purposes and are used in different scenarios.

## **Reasons to use Sub-Processes or Call Activities:**

- Consolidate tasks that either have common features or collaboratively form a distinct functionality.
  For example, a Notification Gateway, which includes script tasks and a service task, works together to construct and send a notification, such as an email.

- Group tasks where a Boundary Event can be efficiently applied to the entire group.
  For instance, instead of individually assigning a condition or timer to each task, all tasks can be included within a sub-process or call activity, where the condition or timer inherently applies to all the contained tasks.

## Sub-Processes

**When to use a Sub-Process:**

- **Consolidate similar functionalities:** When you have a group of tasks that are closely related and work well together but don't need to be used or replicated elsewhere in other processes.

- **Call Activity is not required:** When these tasks don't meet the conditions needed for a call activity, a sub-process can achieve the same goal.

- **Conditions or events need to be applied:** When specific conditions or events, such as a timer event, need to be applied to a set of tasks, but these tasks do not collectively form a reusable workflow that can be called as a separate process.

### **Example Use Case: Restaurant Ordering System**

A restaurant management workflow where customers place an order online, and the system processes their selections step by step. To streamline the workflow, the food selection process is encapsulated in a Sub-process.

**Step 1**: **Enter Name**

- A User Task that collects the customer's name using a web form.

**Step 2**: **Select Food**

- A Sub-process that encapsulates the food selection process.

**Step 3**: **Display Bill Value**

- A Script Task that calculates the total bill based on the selected items.

**Step 4**: **Handle Payment**

- A Call Activity that integrates an external payment handling process.

**Step 5**: **Order Confirmation** - A User Task that displays the confirmation message to the user.

#### **Sub-process: Select Food**

**Goal**: Simplify the food selection process into smaller, more manageable steps.

**Internal Workflow**:

1. **Start Event**: Initiates the sub-process.
2. **Appetizer Task**: User selects an appetizer via a form.
3. **Soup Task**: User selects a soup option.
4. **Main Course Task**: User chooses a main course.
5. **Dessert Task**: User selects a dessert.
6. **End Event**: Marks the completion of the sub-process.
7. **Input Variables**:

- No specific inputs required in this example as tasks dynamically retrieve options from context or form

8. **Output Variables**:

- `selected_items`: A dictionary containing the userâ€™s food selections (e.g., `{"Appetizer": "Spring Rolls", "Soup": "Tomato Soup", ...}`).

## Call Process

A Call Process is similar to a Sub-Process in that it encapsulates part of a workflow, but it is designed to be reused across multiple different processes.
It's essentially a stand-alone process that can be "called" into action as required by other processes.
Using a Call Process can help to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistent execution of the process steps.

**When to use a Call Process:**

- **Reusability:** When a set of activities is reused in multiple main processes, defining it as a call process allows for easy reuse by calling the process.

- **Reducing Complexity:** Breaking down a complex main process into smaller, manageable call processes can make it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Version Control:** If a process may undergo changes over time but is used in multiple places, defining it as a call process allows changes to be made in one place and propagated to all instances where the process is used.

- **Delegation:** When different individuals or teams are responsible for executing tasks within a process, a call activity can be assigned to the most appropriate person or team.

- **Access Control:** If a specific segment of a process should not be available to every user, converting it into a call process helps establish access control.

### **Example Use Case: Payment Handling**

A restaurant management workflow handles customer orders, calculates the bill, and processes payments. To maintain modularity and reusability, the payment processing logic is encapsulated in a separate workflow and invoked using a Call Activity.

![Call Process](/images/Call_Activity1.png)

**Step 1**: **Enter Name** - A User Task that collects the customer's name.

**Step 2**: **Select Food** - A Sub-process to handle food selection.

**Step 3**: **Display Bill Value** - A Script Task to calculate the total bill.

**Step 4**: **Handle Payment** - A Call Process that navigates to a payment-handling process.

**Step 5**: **Order Confirmation** - A User Task that displays order confirmation.

#### **Call Activity: Handle Payment**

A restaurant management workflow handles customer orders, calculates the bill, and processes payments. To maintain modularity and reusability, the payment processing logic is encapsulated in a separate workflow and invoked using a Call Activity.

![Call Process](/images/Call_Activity.png)

**Goal**: Abstract the logic of handling different payment methods into a reusable process.

**Internal Workflow of Called Process**:

1. **Start Event**: Initiates the payment process.
2. **Select Payment Method**:
   - A User Task where the customer selects a payment method (e.g., "Pay on Delivery" or "Pay Online").
3. **Decision Gateway**:
   - Routes the workflow based on the selected payment method:
     - **Pay on Delivery**:
       - A Manual Task to confirm payment upon delivery.
     - **Pay Online**:
       - A User Task where the customer enters their card information.
4. **End Event**:
   - Completes the payment process and returns to the main workflow.

In the example of "Handle Payment," the main workflow remains focused on order management while delegating payment logic to a reusable process, improving both clarity and efficiency.

Therefore, the Call Process is a critical tool for creating modular, reusable, and scalable workflows in SpiffWorkflow.
