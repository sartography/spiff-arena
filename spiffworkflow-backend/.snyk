# when running snyk ignore to ignore issues with "snyk code test"
# make sure to EXCLUDE the id option. Otherwise a bad file is created.

# Works:
#   snyk ignore --file-path=src/spiffworkflow_backend/routes/debug_controller.py
#
# Des not work:
#   snyk ignore --file-path=src/spiffworkflow_backend/routes/debug_controller.py --id=whatever
#
# a single vulnerability cannot be ignored for "snyk code test". Only whole files can be ingored.
