# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file, patches or ignores known vulnerabilities.

# ignores vulnerabilities until expiry date; change duration by modifying expiry date
ignore:
  # in case snyk wants werkzeug v3, in the future:
  # we cannot upgrade werkzeug because it breaks connexion
  # and we can't upgrade connexion because it downgrades werkzeug.
  # this means we cannot satisfy the snyk requiement to upgrade werkzeug to v3.
  # we have a ticket to workaround it:

# when running snyk ignore to ignore issues with "snyk code test"
# make sure to EXCLUDE the id option. Otherwise a bad file is created.
#
# Works:
#   snyk ignore --file-path=src/spiffworkflow_backend/routes/debug_controller.py
#
# Des not work:
#   snyk ignore --file-path=src/spiffworkflow_backend/routes/debug_controller.py --id=whatever
#
# a single vulnerability cannot be ignored for "snyk code test". Only whole files can be ingored.
