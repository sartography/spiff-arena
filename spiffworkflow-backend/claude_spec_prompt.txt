When you add a new process instance metadata to a process model, it would backfill all previous metadata as if you had added it at the very beginning.
This should be a new app configuration option that you can opt in to via an env var.
The configuration option is only available if celery is enabled. If you try to set it to true and celery is not enabled, the app fails fast.
